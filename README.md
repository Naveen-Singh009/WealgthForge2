# WealthForge Pro - Advanced Portfolio Management Platform

WealthForge Pro is a microservices-based portfolio platform for **Investor**, **Financial Advisor**, and **Admin** users.

## Implemented Outcome (as requested)

- Investor registration (`/auth/register` with role `INVESTOR`) now **automatically creates/updates** the investor profile in `investor-service` investor table using the **same user id** as auth.
- Investor can create **multiple portfolios**, each with different initial balance.
- Investor can **buy/sell** in different portfolios independently.
- Investor can **transfer funds between own portfolios** using `/api/investor/transfer`.
- Investor can track **portfolio-wise transaction history** and **overall performance**.
- Admin market data (`admin-service` stocks) is used for current holdings valuation in portfolio analytics (no hardcoded market prices).
- Admin investors list is served from investor-service, so newly registered investors appear in `/api/admin/investors`.

## Important Flow Notes

1. Investor buy/sell flow:
- investor-service validates market stock with admin-service
- admin-service quantity updates are applied
- portfolio-service executes buy/sell in selected portfolio
- notification-service sends confirmation

2. History source:
- Investor history endpoints are backed by portfolio-service transaction records.

3. Performance source:
- Portfolio holdings valuation uses admin-service stock prices.

4. Security:
- Use JWT from `auth-service` in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for protected endpoints.
